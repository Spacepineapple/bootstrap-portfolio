## Description <a id="description"></a>

This landing page was created as my solution to the third challenge task of a
web development bootcamp. For this task, no starter code was provided. Instead,
I was tasked to design a portfolio page using the Bootstrap library using my
previous page as a basis for the design and implementation. My task
was as follows:

1. Implement a navigation bar with applicable links that would navigate to the
   appropriate sections of my portfolio page.
2. Add a hero section utilising a jumbotron featuring my picture, name and other
   information should I wish to include it. As the jumbotron has been deprecated
   in Bootstrap 5, I used the example jumbotron implementations provided in the
   Bootstrap documentation to implement a section that was functionally
   identical.
3. Implement a work section displaying my work in a grid with placeholder images
   links to an extermal website. This section was to use bootstrap cards and
   include a brief overview of the work. For this, I used placeholders.
4. Include a skills section including skills I expected to learn. For this, I
   duplicated the skills section I had already chosen to include in my first
   portfolio page.
5. Include a contact section.
6. Include a footer section.

The appearance of the page is as follows:
